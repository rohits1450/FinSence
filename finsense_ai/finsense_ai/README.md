📌 Project Proposition

FinSence AI goes beyond numbers. It’s a Web3-powered financial companion that blends personal finance, psychology, and culture into one platform.

Built on the Internet Computer (ICP), it leverages canisters for decentralized, secure storage and integrates AI to analyze emotional triggers, track expenses, and deliver culturally contextual insights.

👉 The goal? To help people spend smarter, reduce financial stress, and make mindful money decisions — with privacy and transparency at the core.

❗ Problem We’re Solving

Most personal finance tools today fall short because they:

💸 Focus only on numbers, ignoring the emotions and cultural factors driving financial decisions

🔐 Rely on centralized servers, risking privacy and security

😓 Lack personalized therapy-like guidance for emotion-based spending

🌍 Fail to support underbanked communities with diverse languages and cultural needs

🌟 Vision

We believe finance should not just be about numbers, but also about mental well-being and empowerment.

Imagine:

📱 A student in India receives festival-aware financial advice, aligned with family priorities

🔐 Users own their financial data sovereignty through ICP, without centralized control

🤖 AI offers real-time emotional insights into spending habits and long-term goals

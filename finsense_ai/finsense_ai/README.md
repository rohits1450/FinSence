Project Proposition

FinSence AI is an emotionally-aware Web3 financial companion that merges personal finance, psychology, and culture into one platform.
Built on the Internet Computer (ICP), it uses canisters for secure, decentralized storage and integrates AI to track expenses, analyze emotional triggers, and deliver culturally contextual insights.
Our goal is to help users spend smarter, reduce stress, and make mindful financial decisions with ICP-powered transparency and privacy.

Problem We’re Solving:

Personal finance tools today are limited by:
Focus only on numbers, ignoring emotions and cultural context behind financial decisions
Centralized storage of sensitive financial data → privacy & security risks
Lack of personalized financial therapy or emotion-based spending guidance
Limited support for underbanked communities with diverse cultural and language needs

Vision:

We envision a future where finance is not just about numbers, but about mental well-being and empowerment.
A student in India sees financial advice adapted to local culture, festivals, and family priorities. ICP ensures financial data sovereignty, with no dependence on centralized servers. AI provides real-time insights into emotions, spending habits, and long-term goals

Our Solution:

FinSence AI bridges finance and psychology by:
Tracking expenses & analyzing emotional triggers
Delivering AI-powered therapy-like suggestions for healthier financial habits
Using ICP canisters for fully decentralized, private, and tamper-proof storage
Offering multilingual, culturally-aware financial guidance
Integrating live portfolio tracking and smart savings nudges
Why This Matters:
Emotional spending is a global issue, with studies showing up to 40% of purchases are mood-driven
Traditional finance apps ignore mental health & culture, creating incomplete solutions
ICP integration ensures user data is owned by the individual, not corporations
By combining AI, finance, and psychology, FinSence AI redefines financial well-being
